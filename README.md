# Welcome! 👋 

This repository houses all the building blocks and foundation of my personal website. If you're interested in learning what goes under the hood and all that technical stuff, feel free to look around and do a little inspection!🖥️🌐

If you just wanna see everything all come together, head on over to my personal 🌈✨[website](https://vanvaldez.github.io/personal-website)✨🌈 where you can learn more about me and/or leave a short message for me. Enjoy!
